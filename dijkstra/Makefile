#Makefile for Program 4

# See Cmake/Makefile for a complete commented sample Makefile,
# illustrating separate compilation and dependencies.

# Running "make" can generate many error messages.  Do
#	make edgeList.o >& make.log
# to compile edgeList.c and cause the errors to go into the file make.log.
# When "make" finishes you can read the file with "view", "more", or "less".
#
# Many later error messages can be meaningless because they were caused
# by an earlier error.  Always try to correct errors in order.
